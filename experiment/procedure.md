### Procedure
Find out the output for SA0 or SA1 faults on a specific position -

Step - 1: Give the input of x and y. Here x and y can be either 0 or 1.

Step - 2: If you want to enable fault in any position, I.e., faults on a, b, c, d, e, f, g, or on position h - input fault type.

Step - 3: For SA0 - fault type should be 0; for SA1 - it should be 1.

Step - 4: Click on the Check button to get the result on the truth table.

Step - 5: For further simulation - repeat steps from 1 to 4.
